## Deploy a Node.js server to AWS EC2

Deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk

- Choose a server youâ€™ve built previously
- Option 1: A simple API or Web Server
- Option 2: A socket.io event Hub
- The server should not require a database
- Check in your server to GitHub

Task 1:

- Create a new environment, using Elastic Beanstalk from the AWS Control Panel (GUI)
- Manually deploy your application to this environment by uploading a .zip file

Task 2:

- Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal
- Manually deploy your application to this environment by using `eb deploy`
